## 📌 Project Overview

Aurora SaaS is a fast-growing, cloud-native SaaS platform running fully on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. This IRP was developed to provide a **scalable, modern, and practical response framework** to address escalating cybersecurity risks.

**Cloud Stack:** GCP (Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Kubernetes, BigQuery, Cloud Storage)  
**Data Sensitivity:** High (business data, communications, credentials)  
**Threats Addressed:** Phishing, cloud misconfigurations, malware, data breaches, supply chain attacks.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

✅ Minimize impact of incidents  
✅ Ensure data confidentiality & integrity  
✅ Rapidly restore secure operations  
✅ Ensure legal/regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR)  
✅ Protect brand reputation  
✅ Implement a feedback loop for continuous improvement

## 👥 Incident Response Team Structure

- **Tier 1:** Detection, triage (SOC/help desk)
- **Tier 2:** Technical responders (analysis, containment, eradication)
- **Tier 3:** Leadership, legal, compliance, external communication

## 🚨 Incident Classification & Communication

| Incident Type          | Priority | Rationale                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Breach            | High     | Risk to customer trust, compliance, and business continuity               |
| Cloud Misconfiguration | Medium   | Common in cloud-native environments, can escalate                         |
| DoS Attack             | High     | Critical availability loss                                                |
| Unauthorized Access    | Medium   | Requires privilege assessment, potential lateral movement                 |
| Malware                | Medium   | Often initial access vector, may evolve                                   |
| Phishing               | Low      | Often blocked but remains a top attack vector                             |

**Internal Flow:**  
1. T1 detects → escalates to T2  
2. T2 analyzes → updates T3  
3. T3 handles communication/legal response
